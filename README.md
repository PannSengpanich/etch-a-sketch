# etch-a-sketch
The Etch-a-Sketch project is a web development project included in The Odin Project curriculum. It is a beginner-level project that involves building a browser-based version of the classic children's drawing toy.

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained in the earlier lessons of the course, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a fun and interactive web application. The Etch-a-Sketch project requires the use of event listeners and DOM manipulation to create a drawing surface that responds to user input.

The project provides an opportunity to practice designing and styling web pages, working with JavaScript arrays and loops, and handling user events. It is a great exercise for beginner web developers to get hands-on experience and build a fun and functional web application.
