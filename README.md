# etch-a-sketch
The Etch-A-Sketch project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Foundation Course. It is an introductory-level project that involves building a simple digital version of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained in earlier lessons of the course, such as HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, to create a simple drawing application that allows the user to draw on a grid using the arrow keys to move the cursor. The Etch-A-Sketch project requires the use of HTML to create the structure of the page, CSS to style the page and make it visually appealing, and JavaScript to create the drawing functionality.

The project provides an opportunity to practice working with JavaScript functions and conditionals, handling user events, and creating a simple drawing application that can be played in the browser. It is a great exercise for beginners to get hands-on experience and build a basic interactive application.
